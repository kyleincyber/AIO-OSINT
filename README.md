# AIO-OSINT

Welcome to AIO-OSINT! Please note that this tool is currently a work in progress and primarily intended for personal use. However, you are welcome to utilize and add to it for your own OSINT endeavors.

## Purpose

I'm putting together AIO-OSINT to automate collecting data I frequently need to gather or check for. The aim is for this to be a fully automatic (as is reasonable) OSINT tool.

4. Configure any required API keys, credentials, or access tokens for the specific modules and tools you wish to use. This information is typically stored in a configuration file or environment variables.

5. Run the application using the provided command-line interface or start script.
